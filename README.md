Take Action and Protect the Planet with TAPP!

## Who we are

Hi guys, my name is Siddharth Notani and my name is Advaith Krishnan, and we’re here to present TAPP, a social networking app that lets you take action and protect the planet. How many of you have re-shared an image or a video on your Instagram story about an on-going issue/problem in the world, like the Amazon Rainforest fire recently? (5sec gap) Keep your hand up if you took any action to contribute towards it’s solution (5sec gap). And how many of you have heard of the recent dog abuse in India? (5sec gap). These are two of the many issues we can solve with TAPP.
TAPP allows you to publish images, videos and even live stream to raise awareness for issues which not many people are aware of, like the dog abuse in India AND TAPP also allows you to take immediate action towards all issues with just a tap. For example, the amazon fire, which many people are aware of but don’t know how to take action for it, you can contribute to its most effective solution by just a tap. So remember, Take Action and Protect the Planet with TAPP.
